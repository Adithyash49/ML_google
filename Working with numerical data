Working with numerical data

ML practitioners spend far more time evaluating, cleaning, and transforming data than building models.

You must determine the best way to represent raw dataset values as trainable values in the feature vector. This process is called feature engineering

The most common feature engineering techniques are:

Normalization: Converting numerical values into a standard range.
Binning (also referred to as bucketing): Converting numerical values into buckets of ranges.

Numerical data : Step 1
Visualization, statistics

step 2: three popular normalization methods: better predictions, converge fast, Helps the model learn appropriate weights for each feature.

linear scaling:  (more commonly shortened to just scaling) means converting floating-point values from their natural range into a standard rangeâ€”usually 0 to 1 or -1 to +1.
Z-score scaling: A Z-score is the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean. A Z-score is the number of standard deviations a value is from the mean. 
log scaling: Log scaling changes the distribution, which helps train a model that will make better predictions.Log scaling computes the logarithm of the raw value.
